## What is this?

Satellite is a smart contract on the EOS blockchain aiming to help enterprises increase the transparency and liability of the data of their employees in the context of the new GDPR regulation in Europe.

## Goal & philosophy:
GDPR is now on everyone’s lips, costing companies millions of dollars. While many see it as a threat, others see an opportunity to bump up revenues with new businesses on privacy savy consumers. </br> Employees are now not only given the tools to manage their data but also the help they need to do so. The data privacy officer will allow different stakeholders to access one’s data and depending on the level of sensitivity, will ask directly for the data owner’s approval. </br> Requesters are incentivised to justify their needs in convincing terms to motivate authorisation.The owner is also given full power on modification or, should the situation require it, deletion of their data. This is a non repudiable proof of access rights and edits but most importantly logs of requests from the data stored.

## How?
